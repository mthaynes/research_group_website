		<p><h1>Interested in Research?  You've come to the right place!</h1></p>
		<p> The Haynes group focuses on the field of metal catalyzed organic transformations, commonly refered to as "organometallics".  This field incorporates understanding from both Organic and Inorganic chemistry.  However, you don't have to complete those classes before getting involved in research!  We can get you started with a team whether you are a senior or a freshman.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Our specific research interests lie in exploring the use of abundant metal catalysts as reasonable alternatives to existing methods that rely upon toxic or rare transition metals.  Specific areas of interest are in the expansion of copper catalyzed aerobic oxidations in building organic substructures and the systematic investigation into a series of iron complexes to tune to photophysical properties of the complex.
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>If you are interested in research, please contact <a href="mailto:mthaynes@umich.edu?subject=jmgroup website">Dr. Haynes</a> directly, or swing by his office (180-407).  If the door is open, you are welcome to chat!<p>
